              <p>
                I was really struck by <em>Wildcat’s</em> cinematography and how
                it reminded me of Decarva’s photographs in
                <em>Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>. There is a dim or dark quality
                to <em>Wildcat</em> that is similar to the way Teju Cole
                describes Decarava’s photographs as “playing with darkness.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Teju Cole explains that cameras rarely made it easy to
                photograph Black skin and had a tendency to underexpose dark
                skin. I was really struck by the quote: “Instead of trying to
                brighten blackness, [Decarva] went against expectation and
                darkened it further. What is dark is neither blank nor empty. It
                is in fact full of wise light which, with patient seeing, can
                open out into glories.” To me this quote reminds me of how
                Professor Campt describes quietness not as the absence of sound,
                but fully expressive, and in the same way darkness is not the
                absence of light, but the presence of “wise light.”
              </p>
              <p>
                When I was thinking of dimness and darkness and shadows in
                photography I was reminded of Professor Campt’s theory of the
                hum and whisper. In a similar way that the hum and whisper are
                in some ways opaque and there is a strain or work required to
                listen. Darkness also requires a similar work from the viewer.
                Additionally, the photographs in shadow are also a shield like
                the hum and whisper are in <em>Opacity of Grief</em>. I really
                saw this idea expressed further when Cole describes that when
                looking at Decarva’s work, which shares a mysterious quality
                that expands that notion of darkness “we might come to the
                understanding that they don’t have to give themselves up to us.
                They are allowed to stay in the shadows if they wish.” The
                shadows guard the subject offering space to be concealed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, in both <em>Wildcat</em> and
                <em>Until the Quiet</em> comes, there is a sense of stillness or
                calm. Like Arthur Jafa’s “Crystal and Nick Siegfried” and
                “Sharifa Walks,” the people in the frame are moving, but their
                movements are so slow that it might go unnoticed. Professor
                Campt describes this as a “quiet intensity.” I see a similar
                “quiet intensity” in <em>Wildcat</em>. I think the intensity
                comes in because it is not only the quietness that is registered
                sonically (we do not hear the voices or sounds of the rodeo),
                but also temporarily through the slowness of the film where the
                film becomes thoughtful photographs and images, which sound
                melds together.

              <p>
                I hoped to visualize ruins and ghosts through my photograph of
                my childhood home, which is no longer. A home that once was is
                now uninhabited, an empty space. It is a ruin. I wanted to see
                what would happen when I drew the image and created a ghost of
                my photograph, a double. Through the act of erasure and
                producing ruin I wanted to understand how destruction is not
                merely the end of something. Ruins are generative and lead to
                new forms of meaning as both reflections of the past, mediation
                on the present, and a reimagining of the future.

                Our radical composition aims to answer how
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em> and Carrie
                Mae Weems' <em>A Darker Hue</em>
                respond to institutionalized Black violence. In order to answer
                this question, we examined the use of repetition, cuts, and
                sound as a mode of survival, resistance, and refusal.
              </p>
              <p>
                We created a multimedia slide exhibition using collage and
                music.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process of musical translation of the visual frequencies
                emanating from the cuts in <em>Work Songs</em> and
                <em>A Darker Hue</em>
                illuminated several interesting observations and questions:
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step in this process involved perceiving the listed
                works and becoming intimate with one’s intuitive reactions,
                one’s inner “bell” which resonates, in response to pacing,
                movement, repetition, variation, absurdity, color, timbre, and
                form. Maya found that they were especially struck by the
                hypnotic, trance-like pacing found in the repetitive form of the
                works which were interspersed with subtle cuts of play and
                virtuosity (ex. the twirl of an axe, the glimmer of a sparkling
                gem.)
              </p>
              <p class="indent">
                What feels like a cut? How do we perceive slips and gaps in
                “normal” time, space, and perception?
              </p>
              <p>
                Maya also found that this process was not one that could be
                forced with the mind&#8212;it needed time to seep into the
                subconscious in order to emerge naturally. There probably was
                not enough time for this to happen given the scope of the
                assignment, but Maya tried anyway to sit with the pieces to
                develop a sense of trust with them.
              </p>
              <p class="indent">
                How do we unlearn prioritization of the mind/analytical
                framework in digesting our surroundings? How do moments of
                beauty make their way through one’s subconscious? How long does
                this take? How fast is the speed of trust?
              </p>
              <p>
                After Maya recorded their musical translation, our group went
                through a process of pairing the visual presentation (already
                curated separately from the music) to certain cuts in the music,
                which we found through a group consensus. It was fascinating to
                see how we all had slightly different intuitions for the cuts in
                the music – Niara really enjoyed one cut that was subtle, like a
                hum or whisper. And yet there were certain moments where we all
                immediately agreed. A more universal cut.
              </p>
              <p class="indent">
                How does the artist’s intention manifest in the listener’s ear?
                Is there some sense of the universal? How does truth move from
                one body to the next?
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Radical Composition manifested in a performance involving
                audio and four slides of visual media interspersed with black
                slides. We first allowed the performance to run without verbal
                analysis and then later retraced our steps with personal
                explanation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Slide 1: In
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison,</em> we saw
                critical "cuts," which we put in conversation with
                <em>People of a Darker Hue</em>. The first cut is the falling
                tree. Not only does it cut the harmony and rhythm of the work
                song and labor, but it exposes the dangerous and
                life-threatening work the prisoners have to endure. We put the
                film still of the falling tree in dialogue with a still from
                Weems' video, which shows the visual history of anti-blackness
                and repeated Black death and violence. In doing so, we wanted to
                point out the particular sonic frequency of these two videos of
                Black violence.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also wanted to enact our own cut of refusal and resistance
                using the mourning practice in Weems' video to respond to both
                acts of violence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our second cut was the narration in the
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em>. We noticed
                how the narrator pushed feelings of happiness, safeness, and
                progress in problematic ways. We asked ourselves how we might
                get rid of the narrative or cut the narrative to show itʼs
                manipulative power. We pulled quotes from the narration and
                created poems to highlight the paradox between this video's
                visual and sonic frequencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Black Slide: The black slides in between each collage were our
                way to hold space for reading and reflection and slow the pace
                down so that the viewers could internalize the slides.
              </p>
              <p>
                Slide 2: Our third cut is the context of the
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em>. Here we
                illustrate the surveillance Black people endure. We cut to the
                white overseer to provide context for the violence that might
                not be so explicit or clouded by the prison's narrative as
                harmonious. Similar to slide 1, we put a still from Weems' video
                of police brutality in conversation with
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em> and place a
                still of response to cut the two science of Black violence as an
                act of resistance. Finally, we created found poems like in Slide
                1 using quotes from
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em> to resist
                the erasure of this experience in the Texas prison.
              </p>
              <p>
                Slide 3: We wanted to also look at forms of repetition in both
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em> and Weems'
                <em>People of a Darker Hue</em>. Both the tilling of the land
                and the running on the treadmill are motions that repeat, but
                they also force us to question the systems that perpetuate the
                criminalization and death of Black people. Why is the man
                running? Is he running towards freedom? What would happen if he
                stopped? Does that mean he surrenders? Or is it a form of
                resistance and refusal? We created the third poem from a quote
                from <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em>,
                "Prison is the only place left in this country where the work
                song survives, and its days are numbered." This quote suggests
                the reason for the existence of work songs, and it claims that
                when work in prisons is gone the songs will die with it.
                However, putting Weems' video in conversation with
                <em>Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison</em>
                shows that prison work songs are not gone but continue existing
                in other forms because institutionalized black violence
                continues.

                Slide 4: The first sequence of the Weems' video depicts an
                oscillation between blurry and clear visuals of the
                magnification of primarily Black and Brown faces. We might read
                these stills as calling attention to the camera as an instrument
                of surveillance, policing, and control. Two Black women make
                contact with the viewer, staring directly at the camera and
                making a hand motion where they encircle one of their eyes. At
                that very moment, there is a cut where the narrator says, "I
                donʼt give permission." Although we cannot be sure about what
                that hand motion means and what it means to them, we can read
                this as a refusal to be surveilled not only by us as viewers,
                but the eye contact resists our gaze and makes a larger
                statement against the camera acting as an instrument of
                surveillance.

                <em>Harlem is Nowhere</em> includes Ellison's annotations and
                edits, which inspired us to develop our theory of the draft. The
                draft is something that is never fully articulated. The draft is
                a form of abstraction, which does not obscure but opens up a
                world to the intangible and indescribable. Not only do Ellison's
                annotations, scribbles, markings, and codes distort the pages,
                but as a reader, we have the privilege to see his process
                unravel. The draft is both an illustration of struggle and a
                form of liberation through its endless possibilities that await
                beyond it. It is a gesture to the future and meditation on the
                past. It exists in a liminal space between feeling and
                communicating.
              </p>
              <p>
                The draft connects to the idea of James Snead's "cut" and
                "repetition. In the same way that the "cut" creates space for
                accidents, reflections, and revisions, the draft also invites a
                return that opens paths to new possibilities. The draft may also
                be an index but not like a trace of the referent. It can be
                equated to Roland Barthes' photographic paradox, which is said
                to be that of a "message without a code." The draft may also be
                a message without a code because it is personal and not
                completely transparent. The draft is a form of communication
                that lacks a direct relay through its opacity.
              </p>
              <p>
                I attempted to visualize the draft by showing my notes and
                reflections on <em>Harlem is Nowhere</em> and
                <em>Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>. I created a map of my inner
                thoughts and connections, which may sometimes lack clarity and
                continuity. However, these annotations helped me become an
                active participant in grappling with these image-texts. Through
                the draft, I work to understand the entanglement of the
                repetition of Black suffering that Ellison describes.

              <br /><br />In response to: Jafa <br /><br />
              <p>
                I hope to visualize the "offbeat" through my photographs of
                architecture and absent spaces. Similar to our theory of the
                draft, I think that the offbeat allows room for experimentation
                and accidents. I consider these photographs similar to Jafa's
                method of "worrying the image," which he describes as bending of
                regulated time. Many of these photographs are double exposures,
                which is a technical way of showing two different moments
                simultaneously. In that way, I am also bending time through
                photography instead of film. Furthermore, just as Jafa considers
                the hand-cranked camera a more appropriate instrument to create
                unstable visual frequencies, I think film cameras, like the one
                I used to create these images, offer a similar opportunity to
                create the offbeat.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I reflect upon these photographs, the outliers, they all
                somehow have a surreal quality. They are not overly focused,
                have light leaks, are cut and bent, people are absent, and the
                composition is slightly off-center. To some, these qualities may
                qualify them as mistakes and undesirable, and maybe the offbeat
                to many would also be considered a mistake. However, I think by
                choosing these photographs and choosing the unstable, I am
                undoing regulation and expanding these images' impact instead of
                discarding them as errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also really resonated with Jafa's use of the archive, and I
                was thinking about how these photographs represent my archive. I
                think the archive connects so well to James Snead's "cut" and
                "repetition." The archive is constantly open to cuts. Every time
                one revisits it, one might see something new and connect
                different pieces to one another. The original intent of these
                photographs is completely different from what I am doing with
                them today, and that is what's so special about the archive and
                the idea of the cut.
