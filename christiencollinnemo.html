        Our piece this week, in response to Kahlil Joseph’s
        <em>Until the Quiet Comes</em> (2013) and <em>Wildcat</em> (2013) and in
        conversation with Arthur Jafa’s <em>Apex</em> (2013), is an experiment
        in sonic and temporal manipulation utilizing footage from our third
        composition. We open in silence, creating space for the viewer to form
        their own opinion about the footage presented. We then disrupt the
        viewers expectation by inserting a jarring still from <em>Apex</em>. At
        this point, peaceful music plays to confuse the shocking still. We
        continue this pattern of creating comfort, followed by confusion, by
        changing the sonic and temporal elements to regulate the viewer’s
        emotions and expectations. We continue to insert <em>Apex</em> stills at
        pivotal moments to start to form the narrative of the piece. On the
        level of narrative, our video is meant to offer a perspective on Black
        folks seeking rest in America. Each time that we come close to peace and
        rest, something massively upending occurs and disrupts the peace.
        Further, even after the events pass, it is impossible to forget
        Black-facing horrors; it becomes even more difficult to find peace.
        Ultimately, the video ends with a child (Nemo’s little brother, Jaeden)
        singing the song <em>Enemy</em>. <em>Enemy</em> tells a narrative of
        people perceiving the singer as an enemy and thus making them one. We
        chose to end with this clip because it captures the emotional resistance
        and acceptance that Black folks have to find in order to achieve even a
        semblance of peace in this world. We must ultimately come to terms with
        the travesties that we will experience, or we will be overwhelmed when
        the next tragedy occurs.

        <em>The Tools of the Master</em> is our engagement with John Akomfrah’s
        work on digitopia and Kara Keeling’s concepetualization of queer
        temporality. In terms of the latter, we were struck by the idea that the
        hypervisibility of black people is a product of white supremacy. As a
        result, we asked how we can express something so beautiful to us—the
        expression of black joy—while also protecting the subjects of our
        photos. As a result, we took one shot and duplicated it numerous times,
        altering the opacity and their placement to create a work where black
        joy the people depicted are perceptible, though maybe not entirely
        recognizable. In terms of digitopia, we then asked how we could capture
        the limits of analog materiality and offer a way forward—express a
        yearning for a digital, afrofuturistic utopia. For each photo, we
        altered the curves along the axis of either the image’s reds, greens, or
        blues. As a result, we achieved a visual representation of the limits of
        film, which forced black skin to appear in film stocks that were not
        made for black skin. Additionally, under the amalgamation of these
        altered photos, we underlaid a negative of the original photo. Its
        phantom-like presence speaks to the indelible impact that film had on
        the editing process, as discussed by Akomfrah; indeed, the unforgiveness
        of film made it haunt final productions. Ultimately, we ask how we can
        use these tools of the master for us: folks who were not factored into
        these tools’ creation. As audio plays behind the print of this digital,
        quasi-analog piece, an ominous liberatory potential emanates from our
        work. Bringing together and manipulating a range of sounds, the sonic
        mirrors the value of techno culture in Detroit; it serves as a beacon of
        black ingenuity during massive change. It contends that we can, in fact,
        make whatever medium ours.

        For this week’s collaboration we bring Saidiya Hartman’s “Venus in Two
        Acts” and <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments</em> into
        conversation with <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were particularly captivated by Hartman’s attempt to tell the story
        of women only known through the violence sin the violence in order to
        capture a new, possibly liberating memory of them. In a sense, Hartman
        redirects our gaze. Yet, as Hartman finds, it is impossible to entirely
        escape violence, which ultimately is germaine to many of these stories.
        We found this to be the crux of <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>,
        Hughes and DeCarava’s guided the reader to view Harlemites through other
        people, their environment, and their feelings. These stylistic
        techniques prompt the viewer to understand historical black figures not
        from how they are conventionally portrayed (which is white washed and
        dismissive of their humanity), but to view their experiences with them.
        <em>Through them</em>. So, in order to engage with these ideas, we
        created four classical portraits of women, but redacted the violence. In
        turn, what we ended up making was four blank greyscale drawings, because
        the idea of a classical female portrait is inherently violent; classical
        portraiture of female subjects subjects them to the Male Gaze and
        reduces them to an object for ogling. The only way that we were able to
        truly capture the subject without any semblance of violence was to
        forego capturing them in any recognizable form. We then hung the images
        in balance with each other as an homage to Hartman’s quote that suggests
        our lives and the lives of these women will always hang in the balance.
        We cast Hartman quotes on the floor below the hanging portraits in order
        to capture the idea of lost lives during the voyage, but also to enforce
        the idea of dependency on written archival narratives to imagine untold
        people of the past. The final element we included was the use of an
        essential oil titled “African Queen” to create an olfactory frequency.
        We were keen on using this specific essential oil because it is an
        idealized imagination of an African Queen, which all of these portraits
        were meant to represent.

        Do you feel the tremors?<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In his work, Arthur Jafa explores motion and the absence thereof. Each
        film is a series of images, or a series of moving images. Jafa uses this
        dichotomous physical property–motion–to poke and prod the concept of
        Blackness. In <em>Love is the message</em> in particular, Jafa sutures a
        series of found footage together, creating a seamless flow; the movement
        of one individual seems to map perfectly onto a following clip of
        another person moving in synchronous motion, often in a different
        environment under drastically different context. Yet, in between some of
        these clips are images of celestial objects. Our work aims to engage
        with these motifs. We ask how does a star, burning in a vacuum in its
        raptorious silence, interact with our understanding of Blackness? Does
        it flow or depart?
      </p>
      <p>
        We reckon that these celestial bodies are situated between images of
        Black people moving with a similar grace because they simply are; these
        celestial bodies offer another understanding of Blackness that refuses
        to be tethered to pain, defamation, and all the other taxation that
        comes with an earthly existence. The act of existing in a vacuum with
        all of their effervescent beauty offers another valid understanding of
        Blackness—something that Jafa proves takes many forms and has no bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our film, we intimately engage with this concept. We traveled to a
        site that is mired in violent, bloody history: the Princeton
        Battleground State Park. Here, American revolutionaries fought British
        troops to secure a liberty that would paradoxically result in even more
        oppressive bondage for Black people. Yet, although Nemo is shown
        existing in, and therefore embodying, this violent space, we sought to
        capture them beyond. Like a celestial object, the act of being is all we
        ask of Nemo. In that sense, they come to practice a sort of Black
        celestial embodiment. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of flight,
        expressed through found footage of birds, adds to our exploration of
        Black celestial embodiment. As the incendiary soundtrack,
        <em>Walkin</em> by Denzel Curry plays, we ask: What does it mean for
        Black people to have the audacity to continue walkin? To persist through
        age-old violence? What does it mean to imagine flight? In
        <em>Dreams are Colder than Death</em>, Fred Moten discusses Black people
        in the hull of the ship. There, he argues, fantasies of flight generated
        a radical, disruptive, imaginative capacity. In an iteration of that
        hull, we aim to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        We engage with Jafa further as we manipulate the progression of our
        clips, cutting out portions of a sequence, altering the speed at which
        it plays, and using repetition. These techniques aim to demand something
        of the viewer; we oftentimes disrupt their expectations of how Nemo
        ought to move; we cut the audio, disrupting expectations further,
        forcing the audience to sit with Nemo in silence. In short, the audience
        must let Blackness be, in the chaotic, graceful obscurity of a celestial
        body, demanding nothing more.

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first radical composition is in conversation with the materials
        covered in weeks one and two. We pay particular attention to the visual
        frequencies of Carrie Mae Weems’ <em>People of a Darker Hue</em>,
        Richard Wright’s <em>12 Million Black Voices</em>, and the Seegers’
        <em>Afro-American Worksongs in a Texas State Prison</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, our work examines the relationship between the Black individual
        and the Black collective which is an underlying theme in all three
        selected works. In <em>Worksongs</em>, this is captured in the
        transition of frames—a group of men are depicted laboring in idyllic
        unison only to be cut by a close up shot that fills the screen with one
        man’s body. More interestingly, the antiquated film equipment furthers
        the connection between the individual laborer and the group. In shots of
        the entire group, the viewer hears a sequence of call and response; a
        leader cries out a set of lyrics to his comrades which they meet with a
        concerted, collective lick of their own. Yet, despite these two distinct
        actors being sonically decipherable, the fuzzy nature of the film blurs
        this distinction. We cannot quite make out who is the individual leader
        and who is the collective. A tension arises in this exchange, as a
        seamless flow between the Black individual and the Black collective is
        achieved. Our work wrestles with this relationship, as we separate a
        physically bound collection of Black faces and manipulate how they exist
        in relation to each other. In our film, depictions of Black individuals
        sometimes stand alone, followed by a succession of more individuals.
        Other times, these Black faces are conjoined together in one big shape
        reminiscent of Africa—a formation which serves as the canvas for our
        drip drawing. Yet, no matter which form these 12 million Black faces
        appear, there is an unyielding thread that stitches them together. So,
        as the individual pieces of our drip drawing are passed around in class,
        there is no question as to what collective they spawn from. The flow
        between the individual and the Black diaspora is seamless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another element of our composition translates the abstraction of time in
        the Black experience. This is demonstrated by the visual frequencies of
        our selected materials. For example, through prose, Richard Wright
        conveys time cyclically. The rhythm of time in his fast-paced telling of
        Black movement throughout history shows Black people facing oppression
        by the “Lords of the Land.” He expresses a deep, low tone. Eventually,
        through Black persistence, we feel a sense of triumph as Black people
        migrate to urban environments and experience new opportunities. The tone
        lightens as we revel in what feels like a high. Yet, this is disrupted
        as cotton is replaced by kitchenettes, the Lords of Land substituted by
        the Bosses of Buildings. Again, we hear a tonality that vibrates at a
        similar frequency to the story’s beginning. The notion of time’s
        linearity is even challenged by Wright’s separation of southern and
        northern Black communities. As he audaciously traces each groups
        development throughout history, they seem to exist on two different
        temporal planes: one caught in a state of stagnation, the other
        ostensibly (and maybe nominally) progressing forward. Our work
        translates this rhythm through our dealing of sound. Towards the end of
        the audio portion of our radical composition, the voices of gospel
        singers oscillate between clarity and obscurity; the pitch of their
        voices go in and out of tune; throughout, samples of song and film
        created by Black artists drone on in a dissonant trance. All of this
        echoes the continual march upward of Black people, thwarted and sent
        falling downward throughout their history—from slavery to emancipation,
        from emancipation to Jim Crow and so on. Moreover, we abstract time
        quite explicitly by the idiosyncratic progression and reversal of time
        exhibited by timestamps that adorn the upper right corner of each frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, our first radical composition encapsulates the visual
        frequency of abstraction found across the work we have explored thus
        far. We ask the audience to ponder, how does the Black individual
        navigate in relation to their kin? Their ancestry? How does Blackness
        abide by time? Or does it refuse to abide at all?

      <p>
        Last week, we looked at a series of portraits and landscapes shot by
        photographers as part of the Farmers Security Administration’s efforts.
        This archive of photos was accompanied by text written by Richard
        Wright. Although there were similarities in form between last week’s
        <em>12 Million Black Voices</em> and this week’s
        <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>, we realized that our gaze was
        prompted to do something different when interacting with each work.
        Through Langston Hughes’ prose, each photograph welcomes our gaze and
        directs it through lenses of family and the 1950s Harlem environment to
        achieve an intimate understanding of each subject. So, while Richard
        Wright challenges the indexicality of photographs by placing them in
        conversation with Black history (which is to say American history),
        Hughes directs us to understand the immediate social totality of the
        Black Harlemite. This is achieved by Sister Mary Bradley’s fictional
        narration that reflects on her family. For example, we are introduced to
        Rodney who at first glance may come across as a really shallow figure.
        At least, that is the message that is conveyed when Sister Mary recounts
        his parents “washing their hands of him” and dismissing him from their
        lives. Yet, Sister Mary never lets him fade from her narration. Rather,
        he is constantly invoked. Throughout Hughes’ writing, we begin to
        understand him in relation to his family. His sister Melinda and her
        husband Jerry serve as foils to Rodney. We understand Rodney through the
        poignant description of his son. In short, our gaze is guided to
        understand Rodney through the diverse array of people living in Harlem.
        And in turn, as our gaze probes the series of photographs that accompany
        this text, depicting different men in Harlem, we begin to see
        reflections of Rodney buried within them. Furthermore, just how Hughes
        makes us understand Harlemites in relation to other people, he also
        makes us understand them in relation to their environment. On pages 22
        and 23, a spread of very distinct landscapes are displayed. Hughes
        succinctly describes how Rodney uniquely interacts with each
        environment, or sometimes even possibly fails to. By engaging with
        photos of these spaces, we are able to piece together the deep social
        totality of Rodney. We effectively begin to understand space through
        Rodney, and Rodney through space. This careful guiding of the viewer’s
        gaze is what we ultimately hoped to achieve in our composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Working within an archive</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to how Langston Hughes works within Roy DeCarava’s archive of
        photos, for our composition, we worked within an existing archive of
        photographs that capture a very local Black community at Princeton taken
        by Collin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Guiding the gaze</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using twine and empty space, we guide the viewer’s gaze to land upon a
        final moment that is sweet, tender, and very much a symbol of communal
        love. To reach this image, one must first engage (and wrestle) with a
        series of environments and individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dissonance</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A key aspect of <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em> was the dissonance that
        exists between generations. When Sister Mary Bradley refuses the
        invitation from the messenger, she looks outward onto the Harlem
        community and attempts to make sense of the younger generations who fill
        the streets. There is naturally a sense of distance. She is not always
        able to fully understand each individual. This is characterized through
        the juxtaposition of jazz and blues. Sister Mary wonders why jazz is the
        only thing that makes Rodney move fast. As we learned in <em>Harlem Is
        Nowhere</em>, we know that older generations found jazz to lack the profound
        humanity that was captured by the blues. Yet, even despite Sister Mary’s
        inability to fully grasp young people in Harlem’s affinity to jazz, she
        is still able to retain a sense of understanding—a hapticity to the
        subjects pictured on the page. This is evidenced in one moment where she
        notes “when i was young, they used to play “hot”, but now they play
        “cool”. But they get just as excited as I did.” So, even while there is
        dissonance in the rhythms of each generation—the older narrator, and the
        younger subjects—they retain an intimate hapticity with each other
        nonetheless. We attempted to capture this in our work by displaying
        subjects, scenes, and colors that may appear dissonant at first glance.
        The bold yellow of the second panel may starkly contrast the soft
        violets in the fourth panel. Yet, by wrestling through these ostensible
        differences and probing the connections that span between subjects and
        environments, the viewer, too, is able to achieve a haptic relationship
        across difference and realize the beauty in doing so.
