This exhibition showcases the work of students participating in a pedagogical experiment called Radical Composition&#8212;a seminar/workshop that examines the radical possibilities of collaboration. Taking as its point of departure an understanding of collaboration as fundamentally a process of radical composition through which collaborators bridge different modalities of creative expression spanning multiple media, forms and practices, student groups were challenged to create a weekly collaborative (re)composition focusing on the “visual frequencies” of a series of historical and contemporary image-texts (see list below).
<br><br>
Based on a deep immersion in the work of the artists, scholars and collaborators (some of whom visited the seminar) and building on the collaborative thought and creative practices honed in their groups, each group produced a portfolio of collaborative compositions over the course of the semester. This exhibition assembles these portfolios and celebrates their work. We invite visitors to enjoy the exhibition and understand it as a fulsome model for collaboration as radical composition.
