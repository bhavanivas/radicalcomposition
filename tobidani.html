        Our radical composition deals with embodiment, which we explore through
        three facets of our understanding of the term. The first deals with
        representations of embodiment, the second, with the space that
        necessitates an embodied experience, and the last, the physicality of
        embodiment which includes both psychological and material space.
      </p>
        <h2>
         Representations of Embodiment 
      </h2>
        <p> 
        The primary part of our composition investigated representations of
        embodiment through the photo/text relationship. We identified three
        modalities of representation: CORROBORATION, CONTRAST, and PUSH/PULL.
        Each of these modalities illustrated the ways in which we saw the image
        relating to the text in <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>, <em>Twelve Million Black
        Voices</em>, and <em>Harlem Is Nowhere</em>. CORROBORATION is when the image and text
        seem in semantic alignment with one another. In the case of CONTRAST,
        the image and text are at odds with each other, and PUSH/PULL is a third
        bucket in which there is a less didactic or discernible relationship.
        PUSH/PULL illuminates how the proximity of text and image can enrich our
        readings of both parts. The text might allow us to reach clarity about
        an aspect of the image that was otherwise nebulous, or might complicate
        what might otherwise be an easily digestible image. The text is able to
        worry the image, to complicate our reading, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of our handouts and our exercise in class was to attempt to
        arrive at additional photo/text modalities. Our hope is to continue to
        build on these throughout the semester.

      </h2>
      <p>
        These
        photo/text relationships can be further explored through the process of
        collage, where multiple relationships of corroboration, contrast, or
        push/pull can be put in conversation with one another on the same
        canvas. This collage used quotes from <em>Twelve Million Black Voices</em>,
        alongside images from the same work, in the lower part of the piece, and
        images from <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em> in the upper. When the <em>Twelve Million Black Voices</em> images and text are put in conversation with each
        other, the frequencies resonate in corroboration with one another. In
        contrast, using the more optimistic and individualized images from <em>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</em> alongside Wright’s description of Harlem creates
        a sort of dissonance between the two. These photo/text relationships
        create different representations of embodiment for a viewer, with
        different frequencies and relationships between frequencies leading to
        different interpretations of the texts/images.

      <p>
        Placing these words and images in the space of a map puts these
        relationships in a physical context. <em>Twelve Million Black Voices</em>
        revolves around the experience of the Great Migration along the Ohio
        River and the differences between the lived realities and struggles of
        blacks in the Southern versus Northern lands. The 1900 Census map that
        serves as the background for this work shows the percentage black
        population per country and the blue line in the middle of the midwest is
        the Ohio River. The usage of the physical settings of the works conveys
        a sense of embodiment in the understanding that these photos and text
        allude to real lived experiences of the people they chronicle over a
        physical space. David’s work deals with this idea of embodiment as a
        physical and psychological experience of an individual.

        Our composition this week was inspired by our reflections on Arthur
        Jafa’s process. We began our conversation by talking about the
        difficulty of these images, how it felt to watch these videos and to be
        confronted with the content. We then thought about the labor that Jafa
        would have had to endure in comparison to what we felt the labor of
        viewing was that we were tasked with. While we were confronted with
        these quick pulses of images, in the construction of the video, Jafa
        would have had to sit with these images, take them in slowly and at
        length.  
      </p>
        <p>
        We began to think about how our radical composition could reflect, in
        some way, the labor of Jafa’s creation. This was a real shift for me,
        and Dani in that we were beginning to think about radical composition as
        a process and not a product. We chose these 10 images each that were
        most compelling to us. Per Jafa’s quote, it was our way of locating
        ourselves in the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then each made these compositions in which we varied the scale and
        positions of each image in relation to the connections we saw and the
        intensity of the image’s visual frequency. From this, we were able to
        have two image compositions that were reflective of ourselves. We then
        brought the two of us together through finding these relationships
        across our chosen images. This act of making relationships and bringing
        ourselves through our compositions together was our act of radical
        composition, directly paralleling Jafa’s process of radical composition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were inspired by the title of the video apex and the perceived
        contrast between the title which suggested the idea of these images
        reaching a crescendo of visual frequency when in reality the violence
        and intensity of the images felt constant throughout the video. In some
        moments we felt as if the video was leading up to a scream without the
        sound ever being uttered. The music behind the piece was made directly
        after our conversation about this “scream” and this apex, when I found
        myself thinking about the topics while improvising. I feel that religion
        and music and art are sort of ways to scream out frustration in a
        productive way, which I tried to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then took the images and the connections that we had found between
        our own interpretations and in our video work, tried to connect the
        visual frequency of these images and connections with the tones and
        frequencies of the music. The hope was that the build up into this
        release of the gospel choir would feel more like an apex in our video
        than it did in Jafa’s. Made as a screen recording of a slideshow, the
        method of manually changing the slides in the making of the film also
        invokes something similar to Black Visual Intonation in its
        irregularity.

      <p>
        My thesis focuses on a type of dataset framing called sonification.
        Sonification is the conceptualization of data through sound. There are
        many different algorithms that can be used to sonify, each a different
        way of mapping notes into sound, usually with higher numbers
        corresponding to higher notes. Sonification first started gaining
        traction when entities such as NASA began using it to help people
        understand the layout of galaxies. People have since used the technique
        to make better sense of income inequality on NYC subway lines and to
        convey spatial data to the visually impaired, as well as to people who
        are less scientifically literate. Various projects have also worked on
        sonifying climate data in particular, showing increasing temperatures
        and carbon dioxide levels over time through a more impactful medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sounds used in this project illustrate downscaled temperature
        projections for the Representative Construction Pathway 4.5, which is
        one of the many climate models that attempt to predict future
        atmospheric actions based off of past, determined by certain tipping
        points in human action.
      </p>
       <p>
        Because sound impacts a more limbic part of the brain, it is often more
        memorable than visual stimulus. Different types of music, as well as
        different moments within a given piece of music, correspond to different
        types of emotional appeals to an audience. These differences have the
        potential to make a listener feel different ways about the data at hand.
        Some of them could cause the data to be stored as a more potent memory
        than others, having a greater impact on future actions. Data doesn’t
        have to be numerical. It often instead consists of personal stories that
        make up a cultural evolution. Music has the ability to condense these
        stories into a narrative.

        <br />
      <p>
        Dani’s sounds capture the history of a potential future. It is a
        speculative sound, one that resolves the possibilities of tomorrow into
        the sonic experiences of today. Sound is a medium – as Dani shows
        through her research – that allows one to travel through and outside of
        space and time delineations and linearities. In John Akomfrah’s <em>The Last
        Angel of History</em>, the data thief surfs across time and space to explore
        the artifacts of Black sonic culture. This video explores notions of
        afrofuturism, and how sound can cover the distance between the current
        and the new, as does Dani’s research. In the film, Greg Tate compares
        Black existence to science fiction through similarities such as cultural
        dislocation and alienation. This dislocation is both spatial, if we
        consider the Transatlantic Slave Trade, and temporal, for the
        consequential loss of generational wisdom and the sustained efforts to
        thwart the Black population. Khalil Joseph’s <em>Wildcat</em> provides an inlet
        into a lesser known facet of Black history. His video shows images of
        Black people in what might appear to be a hostile landscape that recalls
        the material geography of slavery. And yet Blackness is sublime here, it
        is awesome and perhaps frightful but culturally deep. 
        
        <p>
         I would like to
        affirm the correlation between the Western, as seen through Joseph’s
        film <em>Wildcat</em>, and science fiction, as seen through <em>Last Angel of
        History</em>. One genre recalls the past, one references the future. The idea
        of the ‘new frontier’, or ‘far out’. These notions coalesce in the
        character of a <b>space cowboy</b>. The essence of the Black diaspora
        necessitates a collapse of time and space; this becomes possible through
        the character of the <b>space cowboy</b>. 
      </p>
      </p>
        <p>
        Our video is a speculative biography of the space cowboy. It layers
        Dani’s sonification under our chosen images, riffing off of our past
        composition based on Arthur Jafa’s <em>Apex</em>. The character of the space
        cowboy, in combination with the climate change music reflects the
        maintenance of autonomies that one has over their potential futures. We
        are able to act now, in the present, learning from the past, in order to
        create a more favorable future. The afrofuturist <b>space cowboy</b> traverses
        through multiple lineages and grants us the gift of futurity.

        A Black space cowboy traverses the ‘new frontier,’ they are ‘far out.’

        The medium of travel for the space cowboy is sound.
        <br />
        By moving through sound, the space cowboy is able to float across time
        and space; recognising the threshold of the Mid-Atlantic ridge as the
        conceptual pivot of the Black diaspora.
        <br /><br />
        The Black space cowboy is aligned with Black feminist notions of
        futurity, in Listening to Images, Tina Campt writes “of a future that
        hasn’t yet happened but must,” the Black space cowboy performs these
        futures.
        <br /><br />
        What is the relationship between the data thief and the space cowboy?
        Keeling writes that “the data thief [is] a figure from the future who

        <br /><br />
        But a space cowboy emerges as much from the past as they do the future.
        <br /><br />
        The space cowboy wrangles the data of the past into a narrative of a
        present that must occur in order to create a future.

        Pg. 11, "Venus in Two Acts," Saidiya Hartman
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In "Venus in Two Acts,"" Hartman presents the absurdities of attempting to
        construct a fuller picture of the lives of enslaved Black women with the
        extant archive. Hartman describes the violence of the archive, and how
        Black women exist in limited representations that only position them in
        relation to the violence of slavery. The text describes how these women
        exist in traces of death and subjugation that impose invisibility on
        their persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hartman ponders the risk of attempting to redress this archival
        violence; she discusses the negotiation between attempting to construct
        an emancipatory image through narrative, and the potential risk of this
        narrative harmfully romanticizing the truth of the violence. In the end,
        Hartman proposes her method of critical fabulation to generate stories
        from the archive that give space to the fullness of Black women’s lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hartman’s method takes form through the subjunctive. In my printmaking
        works, I have also explored analogous methods of generating from an
        absence, of using negative space – the absence of information, of
        history, of trace – to construct an image. This printmaking technique is
        called the reductive monoprint. It is a method that allows you to draw
        through erasure. To allow an image to materialize through and despite
        continual erasures. In this week’s radical composition, we confronted
        Hartman’s ask of us to imagine these two women in the hold of the ship.
        We produced a series of prints that explore the impossibility and yet
        the necessity of this task.
      </p>
        <p>
          &#8212;Tobi
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who had only made prints once before briefly, I was struck by
        the special type of repetition that the process requires, especially
        Tobi’s technique of generating from an absence. This process demands
        that you be concentrated in the present moment as you ink each plate,
        form each image, transfer each print. It is easy to see how somebody
        could enter into a sort of flow through this process, being focused on
        each action and yet somewhat dissociated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, we’ve discussed the nature of repetition, how this
        repetition induces different types of trance, and how intentional
        repetition can lead to rhythmic actions, therefore making the everyday
        more beautiful and conscious. The rhythm of printmaking, specifically,
        can generate a better understanding of the narratives and images at hand
        as they are defamiliarized into the lines and shades of artwork and yet
        simultaneously familiarized through repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lack of complete control over the final product in
        printmaking, and the same image can never be generated twice. These
        things have striking parallels with the creation of a narrative from an
        archive, where the same historical information becomes different things
        as it is expanded upon, interpreted, and abstracted in different
        contexts.
      </p>
        <p>
          &#8212;Dani
  </p>
  <p>
        Trance can be defined as a state of abstraction. All of the prints that
        Dani and I made operate in this state of abstraction. Particularly, the
        portraits modeled off of the illustrations in <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful
        Experiments</em>. These portraits reference images of women who remain
        largely unknown, apart from their relationship to the text that Hartman
        fabulates. The ephemeral and gestural quality to the prints reflect this
        abstract form of representation. They calcify the idea that these women
        can never <em>really</em> be known.

        In Cameron Rowland’s work, he appropriates found objects. By placing
        objects already in existence in the context of his practice, accreting
        objects around themes of slavery, property, and policing, the objects
        take on a new meaning; the archive is complicated. Semantics shift when
        the Institute of Contemporary Arts’ front door is reframed as an art
        object that symbolizes the material remains of slavery and the continued
        dehumanization of Caribbean bodies. We wanted to use another printmaking
        technique to reimagine the found object. This technique is called a
        <em>trace monoprint</em> and we used it to create abstracted reflections of the
        opening quotes in Rowland’s exhibition statement. How do these words
        change, lose, or gain meaning through the rewriting and mirroring of
        their forms?

        A trace monoprint transfers a positive, and yet reflected, image from
        the plate. We used this to write quotes from Rowland’s texts, reflecting
        and transforming the historical words into a state that seems just
        barely illegible. This sort of process is related to Hartman’s writings
        on the archive. Words that meant one thing when they were first recorded
        are often consciously and unconsciously twisted and changed as they are
        compounded with other narratives over time.

        Moreover, the trance state induced by this process meant that the words
        changed in my personal understanding of their meaning, as well. On one
        hand, the larger meaning of the text somewhat disappears as one focuses
        on writing each word over and over. However, specific words gain more
        meaning when they are honed in on. For example, I found myself thinking
        more deeply about the fact that the Fugitive Slave Clause uses the word
        “escape” as I was writing it out. This word connotes the immorality of
        the slave owners. This is notable because it is used in a legislative
        context with the purpose of making that immorality legally okay.

          <b>Conclusion</b>
  </p>
        <p>
        This week was a sustained reflection on the process of making, and how
        alternative processes hold different meanings. Hartman and Rowland each
        have their own methods for complicating, exposing, and resisting the
        archive. Through this radical composition, Dani and I were able to
        explore the methods for this that are possible within the medium of
        printmaking. It is critical that we continue to exhaust the archive, it
        is our belief that it should not exist as a static artifact, but must
        always be poked and probed in the hopes of revealing something
        remarkable.
