              <br />
              <p>
                The three-dimensional, multi-media piece Filling Boxes by the
                collaborators Amy, Izzy, and Miles integrates light,
                image-texts, and objects in response to Richard Wright’s 1941
                book <em>12 Million Black Voices</em>. It consists of a plaster
                model of a plantation field and a cityscape made up of heavy,
                rough buildings decorated with broken pipes and arranged on top
                of a clock base. The two models, physically disconnected yet
                linked in their barrenness, stand as visual representations of
                the two worlds Wright presents in his history of America, the
                rural South and the urban North. The medium of plaster and the
                action of filling cardboard boxes with plaster points to the
                Great Migration linking these two landscapes. The viewer
                encounters these plaster structures through a projection of a
                moving, image- text composition that takes Wright’s words, now
                distorted and broken up, and suspends them in space as they are
                cast over the model. In this way, the textual becomes visual,
                the fragments of text resembling a subway-map, and becomes
                physically present in the model as light.
              </p>
              <p>
                The use of text and space in <em>Filling Boxes</em> seeks to
                touch on a central theme in Wright’s book, the power of words,
                how they can confuse as much as they reveal, how they can be
                placed beyond one’s reach, and conversely, how they can be
                grasped in different spaces and forms, such as in the sermons
                given in a church or in music of a dancehall. Wright showcases
                how the history of America he presents in
                <em>12 Million Black Voices</em> is also a story about a
                struggle to untangle and gain dominion over language. From the
                very beginning, Wright challenges the reader to reconsider what
                they think they know about black people, indicating that
                language has failed in the typecasts it creates: “the black
                maid, the black industrial worker, the black stevedore…” But
                Wright can’t fully explain this history with language alone, he
                must imbue his writing with images, paradoxes, and supernatural
                metaphors. Moments in the text that draw upon the magical and
                the inexplicable paradoxes of black life are emphasized in the
                projection, such as the line “the Lords of the Land had waved a
                magic wand and cast a spell upon us.” Finally, the way a textual
                education has intentionally been made inaccessible to black
                people, a point made both in Wright’s book and in Ralph
                Ellison’s essay on Wright titled, “Wright’s Blues” once again
                stresses the way language has the power to redefine space and
                relationships. The collaborators&#8212;in pushing the viewer to
                notice movement-migration, space-landscape, their own
                positioning in relation to the work, and text as image, as
                map&#8212;seek to explore how words can, as Wright notes, serve
                as a “gateway to a forbidden world,” and thus to new
                possibilities.

              In response to: Jafa; DeCarava and Hughes
              <br />
              <p>
                In the third radical composition, the collaborators are
                responding to works <em>Harlem is Nowhere</em>, Arthur Jafa’s
                <em>Apex</em> and Roy DeCarava’s
                <em>Sweet Flypaper of Life</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the performative piece, <em>Rapid Fire Response</em> by
                Hilditch, Torres and Wilson, there is an intention to create a
                piece that purposely adjusts the frequency to which you absorb
                information from each visual text. Through creating a reversal
                in the way the texts are interpreted, audiences are invited to
                recognize the visual frequency that dominates our understanding
                of both Jafa and DeCarava’s work.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Apex</em> is a series of images collated into video, carried
                together with a loud continuous beat. Every beat is a new image,
                moving so fast you can hardly sit with one before within a
                second it moves to the next. These images range from highly
                commercial media adverts, to deeply disturbing portrayals of
                violence. From one to the next, the tempo creates an unease, the
                viewer is not allowed a moment to breathe, empathize, think, or
                consider. Audience members may become frozen, or overwhelmed by
                the onslaught of images that contrast and reduce the subject
                matter to a deep emotional reaction of discomfort.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key to the composition is one word: Reversal. Reversal can be
                defined as a “change in the opposite direction, position or
                course of action. 1 ” When we consider <em>Apex</em>, a reversal
                of the work is to change its tempo. A reversal would be to force
                a performance of the work in which we have to sit with each
                image individually and absorb them. It would be a space where we
                allow an emotional or physical reaction to each image, in
                contrast to one singular reaction to the sum total of all the
                works in one. What would it be to freeze a frame? What would it
                be to leave a moment where the viewer must sit, work through the
                disturbance and react to it?
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Sweet Flypaper of Life</em> has a different frequency. It is
                a book, a portrayal of life which is separate from the distress
                of <em>Apex</em>. The reader is given room to sit with the
                fleeting moments of beauty and to contemplate, to get lost in
                this familial world. The book is beautifully bound, carefully
                curated. It moves the reader through interior and exterior
                space, through intimate and public moments, and through both
                light and darkness. The images deeply contrast to <em>Apex</em>,
                yet both of the visual texts are brought into this radical
                composition.
              </p>
              <p>
                By taking the art from both <em>Apex</em> and
                <em>Sweet Flypaper of Life Wilson</em>, Hilditch and Torres
                create a book of their own. Each shot is given equal time for
                absorption. Each page is a new image. Each page is split and set
                up as a performance in which for 30 seconds, the artists take a
                pen and annotate the page. This is one’s thoughts and first
                impressions, reactions or feelings. The participant is forced to
                spend less time with DeCarava’s photographs, and a little too
                long with Jafa’s. It changes the frequency in which both works
                are supposed to be experienced, and with this a new visual
                experience is established. By the end of the activity, about a
                15 minute exercise that feels much like an exam, a different
                sense of exhaustion and exhilaration begins. A reversal of the
                intention of both pieces is established.
              </p>
              <p>
                This piece is both a mixture of the experience of the
                annotation, and the surveillance of watching those annotating.
                There are three elements at play- the doing, the watching, and
                the book object we are left with at the end. These three parts
                to the piece feel equally as significant in Torres, Hilditch and
                Wilson’s composition. It represents a sort of undoing of the
                visual frequency, in a way that helps the participant understand
                the works more deeply.

              In response to: Jafa; Joseph
              <br />
              <p>
                The 8-minute video <em>Sittings</em> by collaborators Amy, Izzy,
                and Miles aims to create an environment of sound and image that
                the viewer can inhabit as they dwell on the unstable imagery of
                distorted subjects at rest. The piece responds to Arthur Jafa’s
                development of a distinctly black filmmaking style founded on a
                technique he has termed “black visual intonation.” Rather than a
                focus on subject matter, Jafa’s style places precedence on
                <em>how</em> a film is shot and viewed, favoring irregular frame
                rates. In fact, the subjects in pieces such as
                <em>Sharifa Walks</em> (2015) and
                <em>Crystal &#38; Nick Siegrid</em> (2017) are on paper
                unassuming&#8212;a couple on a walk and a close up of a
                person&#8212;but the way Jafa shoots his subjects transforms the
                mundane into an intimate, suspenseful experience.
                <em>Sittings</em> similarly plays with the mundane. Subjects are
                captured sitting, talking, and laughing, yet through distortion
                of the lens as well as post-production manipulations, the
                collaborators create a hazy confusion of abstracted figures and
                body parts. The result is a visual softness coupled with the
                simmering texture of the digital audio that promotes a conscious
                slowing down and compels the viewer to focus and become
                submerged in a slight movement of an arm or the fleeting outline
                of a profile. In dwelling on the mundane the viewer is compelled
                to question how small moments in the everyday can be
                transformative. The eeriness that emerges from the distortion
                and the superimposing of footage, creating ghost-like figures,
                also draws on the unsettling combinations found in a piece like
                <em>Apex</em> (2013) as well as in the two short films
                <em>Until the Quiet Comes</em> (2013) and
                <em>Wildcat</em> (2013) by Kahlil Joseph. The ambiguity in
                Joseph’s work over whether his subjects are in danger or in
                transcendant ecstasy (drowning/floating, fighting/playing,
                dying/living) creates the potential for a new space or for
                crossings into new dimensions. The collaborators in
                <em>Sittings</em> explore this creation of a new, transformative
                space by aiming to suspend the viewer in mundane moments made
                unstable and eerie.

                revolutionary movement that seeks to subvert the oppressive

                to ponder: Is The Commander a villain or a hero? Is this a
                children’s story or a cautionary parable?

                The power of creativity and imagination in the face of
                constraining circumstances lies at the center of the story.
                Riley, the protagonist, lives in a void that takes the form of a
                windowless room where all activity is regimented. The children
                operate outside the rhythm of the outside society with only old
                magazine images to link them to a world beyond the confines of
                the room. Despite many constraints, creativity exists within the
                four-walls. Riley in particular is able to transcend her
                circumstances and produce something new. She makes art with what
                would otherwise go unnoticed, the residue of a day’s work on her
                fingers, at a time outside the Commanders routine, when she is
                meant to be sleeping. She looks outside the horizon of what is
                possible. Creativity, which the Restinance believes lies in
                uninhibited children, is positioned as the rejuvenating force
                that can fight against the odds of an oppressive order, that can
                reveal a path towards a radical, new future. But is this a rosy
                ideal or is there something slightly amiss in this blind hope?
                The final scene in which the two characters walk out into the
                city is tellingly left ambiguous. What is the Commander able to
                see? How will the two proceed? Ultimately, these questions
                propel the viewer towards a contemplation over the possibilities
                and limitations of a creative practice focused on futurity.

                The narrative behind <em>Before the World Was Bought</em> was
                written collaboratively by Izzy, Amy, and Miles who experimented
                with free association as a way to pursue a liberated mind and in
                doing so fight against the constraints and limited modes of
                thinking and producing art that result from medium, such as
                filmmaking, that carry pre-set conditions and precepts.
                Collaboration, therefore, served as a way to further transcend
                the limits of the individual mind through collective play,
                active listening, and an embracing of randomness, an exercise in
                collaborative narration that resembled an improvisation session.
                The science-fiction genre was chosen in response to John
                Akomfrah’s film <em>The Last Angel of History</em> (1995), which
                mixes documentary elements with scenes that lean towards science
                fiction. In it, the past, present and the future are conflated
                in various ways. Interviewees depict the estrangement of black
                existence as a science fiction story. Black and white images of
                the past are montaged into the otherwise color film, making
                historical figures and past events into fixed, “virtual
                references” to pull from Akomfrah’s essay “Digitopia and the
                Spectres of Diaspora.” Through sampling and music the past is
                collapsed and the future is aspired to through never-before
                heard sounds. This confusion over the past, present, and future
                both in imaged and real form inspired the collaborators to
                create a story where the viewer can ponder the relationship
                between these different temporalities.

                names on campus that may initally appear unassuming but that are
                charged with a history of slavery and white supremacy. By
                engaging in historical research and noticing the way it can
                constrain engagement with the past, the collaborations employ
                Hartman’s subjunctive voice and the sepia tone of a poorly-lit

                The founding of East Pyne (then known as Pyne Library) in the
                late 1800s was intricately tied to the global slave trade. The
                New York lawyer Moses Taylor Pyne was the main donor and
                fundraiser behind the building’s construction. At its peak, the
                family company he inherited, Moses Taylor and Company, would
                transport and trade a fifth of all Cuban sugar exchanged with
                the U.S., a commodity dependent on a slave plantation
                system.<sup>1</sup> By cultivating close relationships with
                Cuban planters, in part by offering financial support, the
                Taylor family was able to gain a steady hold on the market and
                acquire its large wealth.<sup>2</sup> The introduction of a
                modern library served to propel Princeton from a “country
                college” to a leading university.<sup>3</sup> With the
                university's ascension, the source of Pyne’s wealth was veiled
                and he was celebrated for his generosity and devotion to the
                institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Legal historian Lolita Buckner Inniss, writing on Princeton in
                the 1830s and 40s, concludes, “Blacks in Princeton were
                everywhere yet nowhere, frequently crossing town and gown lines
                and without an acknowledged place in the social array.”<sup
                  >4</sup
                >
                Perhaps this seen-unseen state explains the side entrances that
                are still present in East Pyne’s staircases. They prevented
                Black workers from trafficking the hallways which were left only
                for the white, male students and professors. It seems the
                architects, the construction workers, the instructors, someone
                along the line put effort and thought into constructing these
                secondary entries. In their afterlife, covered by brick and
                mortar and no longer functional, the side doors remain
                unassuming and neglected. At most, the subject of passing
                thoughts: a strange decorating decision perhaps or evidence of
                truncated plans. A closer observer notes the slight eerie change
                in the tone of bricks, in their texture...

                East Pyne veils, whispers, echoes. A white man in a top-hat, in
                the business of cementing Princeton as a leading institution. A
                building connected through a history of slavery to Cuba, to the
                sweat and heavy breathing of claimed bodies, to the fertile
                soil, to the sugar cane stalk, to the smell of molasses, to the
                suffacating heat of the processing fecilities, to the train
                tracks built for easy access to the interior, to the port-towns
                and slave ships, to the pedllars, to the contracts...

      Reflection

          Instead of writing individual reflections on our experience as radical
          composers, our group thought assuming the first person plural voice
          for the final time would be most representative of our experience as a
          collaborative trio. Here is our attempt to distill our experience as a
          group into a paragraph:
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than collaborating on a unifying theme or theory that would
          then be interpreted by each member in their own way, as some other
          groups have done, our first instinct as a group was to produce a work
          where our individual modes of expression and contributions would fuse
          together into a single work and become difficult to separate. Our
          first radical composition, Loop, for example, showcases this dynamic
          in that the final work amounts to a set of scanned images that we can
          no longer tell apart. Is that my hand or yours? Who brought in that
          wire again? Why did we land on scanners again? What we do know is that
          the three of us were in a room with a scanner thinking about different
          images we could produce with this machine. Although we could
          individually decide what objects we could scan and whether they would
          move on the scanner or lay still, etc., the production itself was a
          three person job: someone holding down the scanner lid, another
          tapping on the scanner, another swishing a piece of rope. It was a
          collaborative experiment that required being receptive to each other's
          ideas and taking on and off different roles in order to support that
          idea coming to life. Initially shy and cautious of each other's
          responses to an out-there proposition (face on the scanner?), by the
          end of the night we became much more daring and comfortable with each
          other. On this night of experimenting we entered for the first time
          into a distinct rhythm. It was a rhythm that gave order to the
          creative chaos. A rhythm that signaled when repetition was required
          (place objects, scan, view, repeat) versus when a moment had come for
          someone to break the rhythm, for a new idea to emerge. It was a
          playful rhythm, that encouraged experimentation, that was driven by
          the logic of “let’s just see what happens” and by taking a risk. This
          rhythm that we recall developing during our first collaborative effort
          we are now convinced is unique to the synergy that emerges when the
          three of us are in a room working together. Of course, we can
          collaborate with others and enter another group dynamic, but it
          wouldn’t have our distinct rhythm, our district flavor. It wouldn’t
          give off the exact frequency the three of us found we could mutually
          register and operate at. It can only exist in its unique form when
          Izzy, Amy, and Miles are together in a room, talking something into
          existence, as was often our initial step when approaching a
          composition. The process itself of working under this collective voice
          called for creative interpersonal dynamics. How do you encourage
          pushing the group in one direction without cutting off other
          possibilities? How do you release yourself to the idea that the end
          product is not in the sight of any one person in the room? How do you
          go somewhere together when you don’t know where you’ll land? What to
          an individual might seem daunting and scary becomes an adventure and a
          challenge for a group. Part of working in a team has meant carrying
          each other, encouraging each other, and covering different bases for
          each other so that we might each have the freedom to delve more deeply
          into a particular avenue that we would otherwise not have enough
          energy or space to explore. This meant building off of eachother,
          filling holes for each other, and getting braver and more daring in
          our experiments. With this in mind, there is something bittersweet
          about our collaborative experiments coming to an end as it means the
          loss of a space of support and collective growth. We hope that sense
          of camaraderie and friendship that has blossomed between us will not
          end here.
